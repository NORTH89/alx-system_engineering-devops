# Web Infrastructure Design Project

Welcome to the web infrastructure design project!
This project is about designing a scalable and reliable web infrastructure. You will be asked to explain how you would design a system to meet specific requirements.

Please keep in mind that this is a concept project, and you will not be able to implement the design in any real system. The goal is to learn about web infrastructure design by exploring different approaches and trade-offs.

The project has two parts:

1. A set of tasks that will cover different aspects of web infrastructure design. Each task should take around 30 minutes to complete.
2. A final assessment where you will be asked to design a web infrastructure based on the tasks you completed and your own ideas. This final assessment will take around 2 hours.

I hope you enjoy the project and learn something new!

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

- General
  - You must be able to draw a diagram covering the web stack you built with the sysadmin/devops track projects
  - You must be able to explain what each component is doing
  - You must be able to explain system redundancy
  - Know all the mentioned acronyms: LAMP, SPOF, QPS

## Copyright - Plagiarism

You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks below yourself to meet with the above learning objectives.
You will not be able to meet the objectives of this or any following project by copying and pasting someone else’s work.
You are not allowed to publish any content of this project.
Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.

## Requirements

General

- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- For each task, once you are done whiteboarding (on a whiteboard, piece of paper or software or your choice), take a picture/screenshot of your diagram
- This project will be manually reviewed:
  - As each task is completed, the name of that task will turn green
  - Upload a screenshot, showing that you completed the required levels, to any image hosting service (I personally use imgur but feel free to use anything you want).
  - For the following tasks, insert the link from of your screenshot into the answer file
  - After pushing your answer file to GitHub, insert the GitHub file link into the URL box
  - You will also have to whiteboard each task in front of a mentor, staff or student - no computer or notes will be allowed during the whiteboarding session
- Focus on what you are being asked:
  - Cover what the requirements mention, we will explore details in a later project
  - Keep in mind that you will have 30 minutes to perform the exercise, you will get points for what is asked in requirements
  - Similarly in a job interview, you should answer what the interviewer asked for, be careful about being too verbose - always ask the interviewer if going into details is necessary - speaking too much can play against you
- In this project, again, avoid going in details if not asked
