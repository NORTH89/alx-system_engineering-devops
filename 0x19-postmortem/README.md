## Postmortem issue Checkout Outage

**Issue Summary:**

On May 12, 2024, our e-commerce platform experienced a checkout outage from 1:30 PM PST to 2:30 PM PST. This resulted in users encountering a "Payment Processing Error" message during checkout. Approximately 20% of users attempting checkout during this timeframe were impacted.

**Timeline:**

- **1:32 PM PST:**
  - An alert triggered indicating a significant increase in failed database connection attempts from the order processing service.
- **1:35 PM PST:**
  - An engineer on call investigated the alert and confirmed the order processing service was unable to connect to the main database.
- **1:40 PM PST - 2:00 PM PST:**
  - The investigation focused on the database server, suspecting a high load or resource exhaustion.
  - Database logs were reviewed, but no anomalies were found.
  - The database server processes were restarted as a precaution.
- **2:00 PM PST:**
  - After the database restart, connection attempts remained unsuccessful.
  - The investigation shifted towards the order processing service itself.
  - Service logs revealed a recent code deployment had introduced a bug in the connection string to the database.
- **2:15 PM PST:**
  - The incident was escalated to the development team who identified the faulty code commit.
- **2:20 PM PST:**
  - A hotfix was deployed, reverting the code change and restoring the correct database connection string.
- **2:30 PM PST:**
  - Database connection attempts resumed successfully, and checkout functionality was restored.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**

The root cause of the outage was a bug introduced during a recent code deployment for the order processing service. The deployed code contained an error in the database connection string, preventing the service from establishing a connection with the main database. The issue was resolved by deploying a hotfix that reverted the erroneous code change.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**

- **Improved Code Review Process:**
  - We will implement a more rigorous code review process to catch potential connection string errors before deployment. This may involve unit tests specifically designed to validate database connectivity.
- **Automated Testing:**
  - We will explore the implementation of automated integration tests that simulate the checkout process and ensure successful database communication.
- **Monitoring Enhancements:**
  - We will expand our monitoring capabilities to include alerts for database connection failures not only at the server level but also for individual services.
- **Post-Deployment Validation:**
  - We will establish a mandatory post-deployment validation step for all code releases, specifically focusing on core functionalities like database connections.

This incident highlights the importance of thorough code review and automated testing in preventing service disruptions. By implementing the corrective and preventative measures outlined above, we aim to minimize the risk of similar outages in the future.
