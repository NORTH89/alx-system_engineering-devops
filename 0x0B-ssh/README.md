### introduction

# SSH

SSH (Secure Shell) is a network protocol used to securely connect to a remote server and interact with it as if you were sitting in front of it. This means you can run commands on a remote server as if you were logged into it.

The SSH protocol uses a client-server architecture, where the client is the machine you're using to connect to the server, and the server is the machine you're connecting to.

The SSH client is responsible for connecting to the server, authenticating the user, and then establishing a secure connection between the client and server. Once this is done, the client can run commands on the server, and the output from those commands will be sent back to the client.

The SSH server is responsible for authenticating the user, and then allowing the user to run commands on the server.

In this project, we'll be implementing an SSH client that can connect to an SSH server and run commands on that server.
