## Introduction

In this module, we will learn about the fundamentals of networking and how it works in the context of computer systems and the internet.

## What is Networking?

Networking is the practice of connecting computer systems and devices together to facilitate the sharing of resources and information. It involves the transmission of data between these systems using various protocols.

## Networking Protocols

Networking protocols are sets of rules and conventions that define how data is transmitted and received between networked devices. Some common networking protocols include TCP/IP, HTTP, DNS, and more.

## TCP/IP

TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is a suite of protocols that provides the foundation for communication on the internet. It ensures reliable and secure transmission of data between devices.

## HTTP

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol used for transmitting and receiving web pages and other resources over the internet. It allows for the retrieval and display of information on the World Wide Web.

## DNS

DNS (Domain Name System) is a protocol used for translating domain names (e.g., www.example.com) into IP addresses. It enables users to access websites using user-friendly domain names instead of numerical IP addresses.

## Conclusion

Understanding the basics of networking is essential for building and maintaining networked systems. This module provides an introduction to key networking concepts and protocols.
